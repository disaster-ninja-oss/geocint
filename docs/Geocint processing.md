# Geocint processing

This document contains a general overview of the service, information about data sources, layer descriptions.

## **Overview**

Geocint is Kontur's geodata ETL/CI/CD pipeline. It is a platform to process geodata, including producing analytical data in hexagons, building isochrones, etc. 

## Data sources

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data source | Data | Format |
| OpenStreetMap | buildings, roads, osm users, date of editing, mapping hours, tile request statistics | PBF |
| Facebook (High resolution settlement layer (HRSL)) | population | tif |
| The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at JHU | Covid19 data | csv |
| Carnegie Mellon University (Delphi Group) | Covid19 data | csv |
| United States Census Bureau | Population without a car, Population over age of 65, Families living below poverty line, Population with a disability, Population under age of 5, Population with a difficulty speaking English | shp |
| FIRMS | wildfire data | csv |
| Probable Futures | climate data | geojson |
| General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) | elevation data | geotiff |
| The Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) | buildings, forest, shrubs, herbage, unknown forest | geotiff |
| Sentinel Hub | NDVI | satellite data (raster) |
| Worldpop (soon) | population | geotiff |
| Microsoft buildings | buildings, population | geojson |
| GeoAlert Buildings | buildings | GeoPackage |
| The World Bank Group | GDP | xml |
| GADM | Global administrative areas | shp |

## Processing data

1. Extract data from data sources (input data in "data/in")
2. Transform data and place it in db geocint.public as a separate table
3. Transform data into hexagon and place it in db geocint.public as a separate table with prefix \_h3
4. Load data in table stat_h3 and update data in tables bivariate\_\*.

## Tiles generator

After updating the stat_h3 table, the tile generation process starts.

## Deployment to the zigzag-sonic-lima

1. Deploy tiles
2. Deploy tables dump 

From the dev branch, the information is deployed on the zigzag server, from the test - on sonic, from the prod - on lima.
